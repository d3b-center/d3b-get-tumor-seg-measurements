This gear extracts tumor measurements from an input segmentation image and injects the results as session-level metadata on Flywheel.

## :mag: Overview

The gear will take a 3D segmentation and calculate the total volume (mmÂ³) for tumor regions. The resulting measurements are added to the session metadata (for the session that the segmentation file is stored within), as described below.

### Inputs

* input-file: Segmentation image to process (nifti).
* label-mapping: Mapping between voxel values and tumor components.   
    Default:  
        1 = Enhancing  
        2 = Non-enhancing  
        3 = Cystic  
        4 = Edema  

### Outputs

Session metadata updated with measurements for each label: `session.info.measurements.volume.[3d/2d]_[model_prediction/manual].[label]`

Such as (default):

- session.info.measurements.volume.[3d/2d]_[model_prediction/manual].whole_tumor
- session.info.measurements.volume.[3d/2d]_[model_prediction/manual].enhancing
- session.info.measurements.volume.[3d/2d]_[model_prediction/manual].non_enhancing
- session.info.measurements.volume.[3d/2d]_[model_prediction/manual].cystic
- session.info.measurements.volume.[3d/2d]_[model_prediction/manual].edema

Where:
- Whole tumor = total volume of all non-zero voxels
- Enhancing = total volume of all voxels with value of 1
- Non-enhancing = total volume of all voxels with value of 2
- Cystic = total volume of all voxels with value of 3
- Edema = total volume of all voxels with value of 4

& whole tumor volume & subcomponent volumes for:
- 3D volume
- 2D volume by bidirectional measurements at slice with greatest 3D width

### Configuration

* __segmentation_type__ (number, default 0): Whether the input segmentation was created manually or model-predicted. 0=get from file-name, 1=manual, 2=model-predicted. If 0, relies on "manual" or "pred" in the file name to determine the output metadata.
* __debug__ (boolean, default False): Include debug statements in output.

## :exclamation: Limitations

- uses __all__ non-zero voxels to calculate whole-tumor
- calculation of volume from 2D diameter, to be implemented
- support for alternative label mappings, to be implemented
